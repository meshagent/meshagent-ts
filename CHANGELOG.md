- Messaging chat clients now listen for participant add/remove and room status changes, emit accurate connected/disconnected/reconnecting/reconnected transitions, and reopen open thread sessions after reconnect.
- Sending agent messages can now skip waiting for an available participant when the caller opts into offline delivery.
- Thread storage now reissues watch and list requests after reconnect so watched thread state comes back automatically.
- Successful tool-call completions no longer create transient tool-call status entries, reducing status noise in threaded chat views.

## [0.44.1]
- Stability

## [0.44.0]
- TypeScript agent clients now support thread watch/unwatch, multiple thread storages, and richer start-thread payloads, including tool-choice metadata.

- Tailwind chat UI now tracks thread status, reasoning traces, shell output, file attachments, and improved file preview behavior for streamed agent content.

## [0.43.4]

## [0.43.3]
- Stability

## [0.43.2]
- Introduced `@meshagent/meshagent-livekit` as a standalone TypeScript helper package, with `livekit-client ^2.15.5`.

- Room websocket auth now uses bearer headers on Node and `meshagent-room.` subprotocol tokens in the browser, and the agents/thread APIs now carry backend metadata and attachment-aware prompts.
- React/auth/dev/tailwind packages now publish CJS main entries alongside ESM builds, and the new LiveKit package depends on `livekit-client@^2.15.5`.

## [0.42.2]
- Moved TypeScript LiveKit helpers into the new `@meshagent/meshagent-livekit` package so the core TypeScript SDK no longer depends on `livekit-client`.

- Updated Meshagent JS/TS package manifests so inter-package dependencies are aligned to the new Meshagent version (`@meshagent/*` packages now depend on the updated `^0.39.6` versions).

## [0.39.6]
- Chat thread message sending now supports an “agent messages” mode: it selects participants that advertise agent-message support and sends `agent-message` payloads using `meshagent.agent.turn.start` / `meshagent.agent.turn.steer` types (including turn/thread scoping), with Promise-based sending and cancellation when recipients never materialize.
- Chat UI/logic now determines the correct outbound message type (chat vs steer) and turn context from thread status, and passes that into message sending.
- DatasetsClient now adds strongly typed `importFromStorage` and `exportToStorage` APIs with dataset storage format + import mode options, optional `namespace`/`branch` scoping, and `batch_size` support that is omitted when unset.

- Breaking: container build APIs now return build IDs and `stop` defaults to non-forced.
- Added database namespace support and new operations (count, inspect, restore/checkout, listVersions with metadata) plus typed indexes and search offset.
